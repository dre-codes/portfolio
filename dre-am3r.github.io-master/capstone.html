                <p><img src="img/capstone/aqua.png" align="left" class="img-responsive" id="about_pic">The modern world has seen society relinquish the ability to grow its own food, leaving the job to a select few. Additionally, due to the ever growing scarcity of resources such as soil and water, efficient techniques should be increasingly employed when growing plants. One such technique is Aquaponics, a system of aquaculture in which waste produced by fish is used to supply nutrients to plants, in exchange, purifying the water for the fish. Aquaponics is however a very involved practice that requires a level of time, equipment and knowledge that the average person does not possess. Our solution aims to make the act of operating such a system as effortless as possible. This is achieved through the automation of the aquaponics cycle as well as providing users with remote monitoring facilities through web and mobile apps. The home friendly system gives anyone the opportunity to grow their own food without much hassle.</p>

                                <p>Doing this project was a great learning experience, especially being a web developer focused on static websites. This project taught me about APIs, how they work, their purpose and how to interact with them. I was also able to tackle Javascript and modifying the DOM. Javascript was used to interact with the endpoints of our inhouse API and the values then passed to an external javascript library to then draw and animate charts on the website.</p>

                                <p>We opted for our client side applications to be real time or as near to realtime as possible so it is more beneficial to the user, as a result our api was pushing data at set time interval. The problem was whenever the charts pulled data from the api the chart was drawn once, when new data is pushed the charts were not redrawn and it became apparent that it was not dynamic. As a quick fix I implemented a timer to refresh the browser at the same time interval that the API was pushing data, that way the chart would be current and the user would enjoy the visuals of the charts being reanimated. Of course this method could have been improved by using AJAX so that the charts were reloaded instead of the entire webpage however time was against the team.</p>

                                <p>This project turned out to be one of my biggest accomplishments. I was forced to step out of my comfort zone of static websites and had to learn quickly to meet deadlines. I also had to work with a team which I enjoyed, learning more about other members' strengths and seeing all our hard work pay off was truly amazing. Our project impressed computer science lecturers, so much so that it was chosen to represent the department of Computer Science in a science fair at the university. The project was demonstrated to onlookers and was later judged where it ultimately took first place. Thanks to everyone that helped in this project. </p>
